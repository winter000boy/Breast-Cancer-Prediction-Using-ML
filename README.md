# Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to detect breast cancer based on clinical data. The model aims to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign, leveraging various machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Breast Cancer Detection Using ML.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation steps.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses a breast cancer dataset containing clinical data on various tumors. Each data point includes features such as radius, texture, smoothness, and compactness, which help in classifying tumors as malignant or benign.
